Hello!!

We are Mbarete Bot a team from Paraguay. We are glad you are checking our code. 


While you are reading the code, please keep in mind the following points:

    - Keep in mind that we are new to programming. Our knowledge of python programming, 
     and especially pybricks is only a few months of learning.

    - We don't have a tutor that has guided us through the development of this code, 
    we just try to apply what we have learned through our research.

    - The purpose of sharing this code with others is to receive as much feedback as possible. 
    We really have no idea if our code is built the right way. 
    So please, if you want to help us, send us your opinion and try to be as detailed as possible.
    


Finally the code: 


The code we use to control the robot is split into 4 files.
 
We recommend you to check them in this order:

README.txt > control.py > ev3_device.py > mbarete.py > main.py


Please, if possible share your opinion and possible suggestions to improve our code.

Our email is: mbaretebot@gmail.com

Ps: This is a README file for Philip, we want to share our code with more people,
so let us know if this README file is well done :D.
