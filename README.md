# Hello!!

We are Mbarete Bot a team from Paraguay. We are glad you are checking our code. 


While you are reading the code, please keep in mind the following points:

```
    - Keep in mind that we are new to programming. Our knowledge of python programming, 
     and especially pybricks is only a few months of learning.

    - We don't have a tutor that has guided us through the development of this code, 
    we just try to apply what we have learned through our research.

    - The purpose of sharing this code with others is to receive as much feedback as possible. 
    We really have no idea if our code is built the right way. 
    So please, if you want to help us, send us your opinion and try to be as detailed as possible.
 ```  




Please, if possible share your opinion and possible suggestions to improve our code.
