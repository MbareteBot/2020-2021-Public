# Hello!!

We are MbareteBot a team from Paraguay and we are glad you are checking our code!. 

Right now you will only find the code we use for our robot in Robot/src.

Some cool features we use in our robot:

	- PID control
	- A path generator based on cartesian coordenates
	- Multithreading based control for the robot in case of failure


Please, help us improve our code by sending us some feedback and possible suggestions at mbaretebot@gmail.com :)
