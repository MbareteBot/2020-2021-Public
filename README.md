# Hi there!
## We are MbareteBot, a team from Paraguay and we are glad you are checking our code!

Right now you will find the code we use for our robot in Robot/src

Some cool features we use in our robot:

  * PID Control
  * A path generator based on cartesian coordenates
  * Multithreading based control for the robot in case of failure


Please, help us improve our code by sending us some feedback and possible suggestions at mbaretebot@gmail.com :)
